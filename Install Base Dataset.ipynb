According to Kurvinen (2017), the typical data on install base includes a listing of products which are installed at a given customer site. Futhermore, it can include additional variables such as serial numbers, hardware and software revisions, warranty and service contracts. \n",

These discrete values can be text or numeric in nature (or even unstructured data like images!). There are two major classes of categorical data, nominal and ordinal.\n",

Consider a simple example of weather categories, as depicted in the following figure.
