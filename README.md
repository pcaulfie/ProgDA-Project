# ProgDA-Project
Project 2019 for Programming for Data Analysis

## About ProgDA-Project
This repository contains my submission for Project 2019 for Programming for Data Analysis course. 
The purpose of this project is to synthesise/simulate a data set using the Python package which closely match's the properties of a real world phenomenon of my choosing.

I have created a [Jupyter notebook](http://https://github.com/pcaulfie/ProgDA-Project/blob/master/ProgDA-Project.ipynb) to documenting my investigation and simulation of the phenomenon.

## Problem statement
There are four distinct tasks carried out in my Jupyter notebook.
1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
2. Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
3. Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible using the Python numpy.random package
4. Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.


## Installation

- I recommend that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution of python which contains all the libraries used, as well an instance of Jupyter notebook.
